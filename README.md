# Introduction  
<div>
Causal-VLReasoning is a python open-source framework based on PyTorch for causal relation discovery, causal inference that implements state-of-the-art causal learning algorithms for various visual-linguistic reasoning tasks, detail see on <a hraf="">Documentation</a>.
<p> </p>

<summary>Major features</summary>

- **Modular Design**

  We decompose the causal framework of visual-linguistic tasks into different components and one can easily construct a customized causal-reasoning framework by combining different modules.

- **Support of multiple tasks**

  The toolbox directly supports multiple visual-linguistic reasoning tasks such as **VQA**, **Image/Video Caption**, **Medical Report Generation**, **Model Generalization and Robustness** and so on.

- **State of the art**

  The toolbox stems from the codebase developed by the HCPLab team, who dedicated to solving a variety of complex logic tasks through causal reasoning, and we keep pushing it forward.

Our Causal-VLReasoning implements methods for visual-linguistic causal learning:

* VQA.
* Image/Video Captioning.
* Medical Report Generation.
* General causal representation learning.
* General causal discovery methods.
* Multiple utilities for building your own method, such as independence tests, score functions, graph operations, and evaluations.

## Installation

Please refer to Installation for [installation]() instructions.

Briefly, to use Causal-VLReasoning, we could install it using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/Causal-VLReasoning/):

```
pip install Causal-VLReasoning
```

## Running examples

For causal discovery, there are various running examples in the **‚Äòtests‚Äô** directory.

For the implemented modules, we provide unit tests for the convenience of developing your own methods.
