# Method
This section provides a summary of representative state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms for several Visual-Linguistic Reasoning task, such as visual question answering (VQA) and medical report generation tasks. All algorithms have been implemented using PyTorch. The CausalVLR library will be continuously updated in the coming years. In this section, we will provide a concise introduction to the selected algorithms.
